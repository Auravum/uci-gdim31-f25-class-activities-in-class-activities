"Hello, World!"

In the Hierarchy, move the Camera off of the Cat GameObject, so that it’s no longer a
child of the Cat. What happens when you run the game now, and why?
- It no longer follows the cat as it moves, because it's not a child of the cat anymore and doesn't share the cat's transformations

### W2
*Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?*
They actually seem to be stored as doubles? The f at the end is necessary, because unity apparently doesn't see the r, b, g variables as floats. But, they're represented with decimnals because the range is from 0 to 1, forcing you to use decimals to get any other number.

*Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?*
because it increments, so only whole numbers are needed. You can't do half a bounce after all. You also are doing more than one bounce, so a boolean won't work, and unless you want a huge switch statement saying "if bounces == 1, bounces = 2; if bounces == 2, bounces = 3;...", it's just not a good option

*The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?*
I didn't get an error from Step 4, but I did get errors in several other places for not including the "f" at the end of assigning the r, g, b values.
